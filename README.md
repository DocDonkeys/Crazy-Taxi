# Crazy Taxi by Doc Donkeys
This is a university project made by [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/) (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia) students of the TTC (Talent Tech Center) in Barcelona, in which we make a physics-based Crazy Taxi tribute in C & C++. We primarly used the [Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) and [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) libraries.

Crazy Taxi (our version) is a physics-based racing game where you have to transport passangers to randomly located points in a randomly generated city full of obstacles.
